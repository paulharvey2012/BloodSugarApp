        Explicitly list your Room/SQLite database files to avoid restoring unexpected files
        (which can cause 'permission denied' if they live on external storage).
        The Room database filename used by this project is 'reading_database'.
        If you use Write-Ahead Logging (WAL), include the -wal and -shm files too.

    <!-- Actual DB files for this app -->
    <include domain="database" path="reading_database" />
    <include domain="database" path="reading_database-wal" />
    <include domain="database" path="reading_database-shm" />

    <!--
        If you truly need to include everything under the database directory, you can
        revert to including the entire database directory, but that is less safe:
        <include domain="database" path="." />

        Exclude the app's Room/SQLite database files from Android Auto Backup.
        If the system restores the DB on reinstall, the app will find a non-empty
        database and will skip the one-time auto-import of the latest backup.
        By excluding the DB here, we ensure the database is fresh on a reinstall
        and allow the app's own backup/restore logic to run and import the latest
        backup file.

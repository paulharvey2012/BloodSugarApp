#
#   (1) You need a POSIX-compliant shell to run this script. If your /bin/sh is
#       nawk, bash, ksh, pdksh, zsh, ash, or dash, you should be able to use
#       this script.
#
#   (2) If you do not have Java installed, or if Java is not in your PATH,
#       you should fix that before running this script.
